Elliott Straube's One Pager

I have two ideas for my project.

One is a machine learning algorithm around data at my company, to do unsupervised representation (extracting structure) on the data.

Some sample data is in this folder labeled Sample_Atlassian.csv



Another idea is to do a prediction on how likely a prediction model on an average income in a city using only the weather. 
Hypothesis is that colder cities make more money. People with good weather don't work as hard :)
