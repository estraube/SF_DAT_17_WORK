Problem statement and hypothesis

I would like to predict how “upvoted” a reddit comment will be. My hypothesis is that certain words will be present in the most upvoted comments (and that this will vary by subreddit).
Description of your data set and how it was obtained

Kaggle Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/reddit-comments-may-2015

Description of any pre-processing steps you took

I’m pretty good at SQL, so I pre-prepare the dataset that I import with SQLite, and then move it into a Dataframe after it is a more management size (for speed) and format. 

What you learned from exploring the data, including visualizations

Here is an EDA I did: https://www.kaggle.com/estraube/reddit-comments-may-2015/comments-per-post-per-subreddit

Certain subreddits (the sports ones) have many comments per average post. This may lead to a dilution in the value of each individual comment.

How you chose which features to use in your analysis

I am an avid reddit user and this was the best dataset I can find. Comment and human behavior interest me. 

Details of your modeling process, including how you selected your models and validated them

Models are still TBD. I am leaning towards a 

Your challenges and successes

A big challenge so far is the size of the dataset which leads to slow processing time. I want to use all of the data for a month, so to potentially reduce the size I will focus on specific subreddits.

I am happy I was able to create a live EDA script in the Kaggle platform. 

Possible extensions or business applications of your project

This would be interesting for an automated comment displaying formula (which reddit has). This would help them predict what comments will be popular and surface them to the top. 

Conclusions and key learnings

TBD
